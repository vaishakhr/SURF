# SURF
 The SURF Algorithm to learn univariate distributions

The file surf.m defines the function surf(n, alp, deg)
n is number of samples
alp is the parameter alpha. A nice value is alp = 0.25
deg is the degree of polynomial. Code written to work for deg<=4

Code is currently written recursively and may take some time to run, especially for higher degrees

Also contains several experiment files corresponding to our NeurIPS 2020 paper
