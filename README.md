# SURF
 The SURF Algorithm to learn univariate distributions

The file surf.m defines the function surf(n, alp, deg)
1. n is number of samples
2. alp is the parameter alpha. A nice value is alp = 0.25
3. deg is the degree of polynomial. Code written to work for deg<=4

Code is currently written recursively and may take some time to run, especially for higher degrees

Also contains several experiment files corresponding to our NeurIPS 2020 paper. Use one of these experiment files e.g. salary_experiments.m or synthetic_experiments.m to get started quickly.
